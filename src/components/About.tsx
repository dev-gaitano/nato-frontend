          very woman is a masterpiece, and my designs celebrate her unique
          colors, shapes, and spirit. At NATO, fashion is more than styleâ€”it's a
          movement of inclusivity, embracing women and vulnerable communities
          with designs that honor all body types. Sustainability is at our core,
          weaving eco-consciousness into every stitch. Proudly Kenyan, our
          collections pulse with the rhythm of Africa, blending heritage with
          modern elegance. From bespoke couture to ready-to-wear, NATO is a
          tapestry of artistry, purpose, and empowerment.{" "}
